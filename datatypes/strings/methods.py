'banana'

.center(width[, fillchar])
Returns a centered string of length width. Padding is done using the specified fillchar (default is a space).

fruit = 'banana'
fruit.center(10)
'  banana  '
fruit.center(10, '*')
'**banana**'

.find(sub[, start[, end]])
Returns the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found, such that sub is contained in the slice s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Returns -1 if sub is not found.

fruit = 'banana'

2

.split(char)
Returns a list containing all the characters in the string split into sections with the given character
